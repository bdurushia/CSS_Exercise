          <h2>Countdown to Impact</h2>
          <p>
            I asked him a third time, <strong><em>‚ÄúSir, can you please take your earbuds out so that you are able to hear clearly and work with us?‚Äù</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>‚ÄúNah man, I ain't taken nothin' out.‚Äù</em></strong><br>
            The young man finally muttered, staggering away from me, sticking behind the line of other laborers. 
            I turned towards Peyton, a laborer from a company called 'Stage Works', and asked him,
            <br><strong><em>‚ÄúCan you go get Kim,‚Äù</em></strong> 
            (the labor contractor)
            <strong><em>‚Äúand have her remove him from the job site since he isn't willing to cooperate with us?‚Äù</em></strong><br>
            Peyton nodded and started towards Kim. 
            I backed away slightly, looking at the heavy dome-tarp we were working with, thinking about my next steps. The young man with the earbuds started toward me.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù, he said with a slightly clenched jaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>‚ÄúI said, 'if you can't take your earbuds out to work with us, I can't have you on my job site.‚Äô‚Äù</em></strong><br>
            As I finished my sentence, I had turned my head to look at him and without any notice :<br><strong>WHAM!!!</strong><br>
            My face was met by his fist. 
            Vision goes black and with partial awareness of my body, I crumpled towards the ground. 
            My vision came back by the time my rear-end hit the field turf. I sat there, dazed, wondering first why he felt it necessary to punch me over something so petty, 
            and secondly why I still worked for a company that puts me in position with hot-headed temporary day laborers.

          <h2>Dazed & Confused</h3>
          <p>
            I've often had to ask day laborers to remove their earbuds so they can hear me clearly as I call directions out to the group. 
            I was basically in automated-work mode. Keeping a calm tone, with an agreeable reason, 
            and the slightly calm threat of <strong><em>‚Äúif you can't then I can't.‚Äù</em></strong><br>Never would I have expected to get punched in the face for it. 
          </p>
          <p> I spat out bits of my teeth into the palm of my hand; also catching the falling blood from my face. 
            Although the blow to my nose had my eyes watering, I may have slightly been crying. 
            I've been wanting out of this day job life for quite some time. My progress has been slow. 
            Why would someone be so angry, to punch a calm person in the face? 
            What type of life does this young man lead where he can't take his earphones out while at work 
            and is willing to act with violence to anyone who requests his ears to be open? 
            Why are humans aggressive? Who am I and what am I doing here?
          </p>

            <h2>Accepting the Unexpected</h3>
            <h3 id="quote">
              <em>‚ÄúTo expect the unexpected shows thoroughly modern intellect.‚Äù</em> - Oscar Wilde
            </h3>
            <p>
              The meaning of the quote, to expect the unexpected, essentially is to be ready for anything and be able to adapt to change. 
              It's a rather funny phrase to me, though, because even when you think you are expecting the unexpected, 
              a wild card is played and something will go more wrong than you've prepared yourself for. 
              To me, expecting the unexpected is keeping in the present moment and building the ability to adapt to sudden changes. 
              Even when your vision goes black, if you've got your thoughts running you can analyze the situation and quickly make the best next decision.
